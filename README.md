# GoogleMapsMVTPlayground

A modular, Vite-based project that demonstrates various approaches to displaying maps and spatial data, including custom vector tiles, deck.gl integrations, OpenLayers, and raster tiles. This playground is meant to help you explore, compare, and experiment with different mapping techniques in one place.

## Project Overview

This repository is a collection of different techniques and libraries for displaying geospatial data on the web. It was built using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to keep things simple, modular, and lightning-fast. Whether you want to work with vector tiles, overlay advanced visualizations, or leverage other mapping libraries, this project has you covered.

### Goals
- **Showcase** multiple ways of integrating map data in a single project.
- **Compare** performance, complexity, and styling capabilities of various approaches.
- **Serve** as a learning resource and foundation for more advanced mapping applications.

├── vite.config.js         # Vite configuration
└── README.md              # You are here!

- **`public/`**: Houses static files that Vite will serve as-is.  
- **`src/approaches/`**: Each subfolder represents a unique method or library used to display map data.

## Approaches

1. **Custom Vector Tiles**  
   Demonstrates loading vector tiles from a custom source. Great if you have your own tile server or want to explore the raw MVT approach.

2. **deck.gl Integration**  
   Combines [deck.gl](https://deck.gl/) with a base map, allowing for highly performant and customizable data-driven layers (e.g., scatterplots, heatmaps, and more).

3. **OpenLayers**  
   Uses [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/) to handle map rendering. OpenLayers is a robust library offering many built-in interactions and layer types.

4. **Raster Tiles**  
   Showcases fetching and displaying raster (image) tiles. Useful for fallback or simpler use cases that don’t require vector-based styling.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<YourUser>/GoogleMapsMVTPlayground.git
   cd GoogleMapsMVTPlayground

2. **Install Dependencies** 
   ```bash
      npm install

3. **Run the Dev Server**
      ```bash
      npm run dev

Vite will start a local development server. Open the provided URL in your browser to see the project running.

## Usage

Inside `src/approaches/`, you’ll find separate folders for each approach. Here are some ways you can explore:

- **Directly Load a Demo:** Modify `src/main.js` to import and run the code from one of the approach folders.
- **Switching Approaches:** If you’d like a more advanced setup, implement a simple router or a menu in `src/main.js` to toggle between approaches at runtime.
- **Customizing:** Feel free to add your own tile servers, styles, or data layers. Each approach can be extended with custom logic or integrated with external APIs.
